# Ante-hoc_Explainability_Concepts
This project is for the paper: "A Framework for Learning Ante-hoc Explainable Models via Concepts" (CVPR 2022) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11761). Some codes are from the implementation of the paper [Towards Robust Interpretability with Self-Explaining Neural Networks].

To-do:
- Codebase for other datasets are coming soon.
